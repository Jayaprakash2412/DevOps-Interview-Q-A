1: What is Kubernetes?
A: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

2: What is a Pod in Kubernetes?
A: A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network and storage resources.

3: What is a Service in Kubernetes?
A: A Service is a Kubernetes resource that exposes Pods to allow communication between components of an application or external clients,
   providing a stable endpoint despite pod IP changes.

4: What is a Deployment in Kubernetes?
A: A Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and Pods, ensuring the desired number of Pods are running and allowing rolling updates or rollbacks.

5: What are Kubernetes Namespaces?
A: A Namespace provides logical partitioning of cluster resources. It helps separate environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) or teams within the same cluster.

6: How does Kubernetes achieve self-healing?
A: Kubernetes restarts failed containers, replaces unresponsive Pods, and reschedules workloads on healthy nodes to maintain desired state automatically.

7: What kind of workloads can Kubernetes run?
A: Kubernetes can run stateless applications, stateful applications (databases, message queues), and batch workloads (jobs, cron jobs).

8: What is a ReplicaSet?
A: A ReplicaSet is a Kubernetes object that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. 
   It automatically replaces pods if they fail or are terminated.

9: What is an Ingress in Kubernetes?
A: An Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that manages external access to services, typically HTTP/HTTPS, providing routing, SSL termination, and load balancing features.

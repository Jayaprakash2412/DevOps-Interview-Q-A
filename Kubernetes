1: What is Kubernetes?
A: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

2: What is a Pod in Kubernetes?
A: A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network and storage resources.

3: What is a Service in Kubernetes?
A: A Service is a Kubernetes resource that exposes Pods to allow communication between components of an application or external clients,
   providing a stable endpoint despite pod IP changes.

4: What is a Deployment in Kubernetes?
A: A Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and Pods, ensuring the desired number of Pods are running and allowing rolling updates or rollbacks.

5: What are Kubernetes Namespaces?
A: A Namespace provides logical partitioning of cluster resources. It helps separate environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) or teams within the same cluster.

1: What is Jenkins primarily used for?
A: Jenkins is a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) automation server that helps build, test, 
    and deploy applications automatically to speed up software delivery.

2: What is a Jenkins job?
A: A Jenkins job is a configured task in Jenkins that defines steps such as compiling code, running tests, or deploying code to an environment.

3: What is a Jenkins pipeline?
A: A Jenkins pipeline defines the series of steps for building, testing, and deploying applications as code (either scripted or declarative), 
   providing better manageability and repeatability of CI/CD.

4: What is the purpose of Jenkins plugins?
A: Plugins extend Jenkinsâ€™ functionality, enabling integrations with version control systems, build tools, test frameworks, cloud providers, and more.

5: What is the default port number for Jenkins?
A: Jenkins runs on port 8080 by default, which can be changed from its configuration files.

6: What is the difference between Freestyle and Pipeline jobs in Jenkins?
A: Freestyle jobs are simple, GUI-based job configurations. Pipeline jobs define build workflows as code (using Groovy/Declarative syntax), 
   providing better flexibility and version control.

7: What are Jenkins agents?
A: Jenkins agents (or nodes) are worker machines connected to the Jenkins master that execute build tasks, enabling distributed and parallel workloads.

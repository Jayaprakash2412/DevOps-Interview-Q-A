1: What problem does Docker solve?
A: Docker enables packaging applications into containers, making them portable and consistent across environments by isolating dependencies and configurations.

2: What is the difference between a container and an image?
A: An image is a static blueprint that contains application code, libraries, and dependencies. 
   A container is a running instance of an image that executes in an isolated environment.

3: Explain the use of Dockerfile.
A: A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions to build a Docker image. It defines base image, environment, dependencies, and commands to run when the container starts.

4: How do you check the list of running containers?
A: By using the command: docker ps
   This shows active running containers with their IDs, status, and ports.
